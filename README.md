# Web-tekniikat: JS Final Assignment

## Basic Pokedex
Created a very simple Pokédex interface for the first 151 Pokémon. The user can choose a Pokémon 
1) from a roster of sprite images,
2) from a written navigation list, or 
3) by using the search bar at the top of the page.

## The tools

Built with
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- VSCode

Also used in this project: [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

## The shoulda-coulda-woulda

The original plan was to create more filters for the main sprite gallery (e.g. by type, or by generation if more generations added) and to display more information about individual Pokémon. Didn't manage to get that far before the deadline, but I feel like I got the hang of the basic principals of utilizing APIs.
